    "The primary focus of this module is adding the ability to design linear phase FIR filters from user friendly amplitude response requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most digital filter design is motivated by the desire to approach an ideal filter. Recall an ideal filter will pass signals of a certain of frequencies and block others. For both analog and digital filters the designer can choose from a variety of approximation techniques. For digital filters the approximation techniques fall into the categories of IIR or FIR. In the design of FIR filters two popular techniques are truncating the ideal filter impulse response and applying a window, and optimum equiripple approximations [Oppenheim2010](https://www.amazon.com/Discrete-Time-Signal-Processing-3rd-Prentice-Hall/dp/0131988425/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1519940790&sr=8-1&keywords=oppenheim+discrete+time+signal+processing&dpID=51v48p99JjL&preST=_SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_&dpSrc=srch). Frequency sampling based approaches are also popular, but will not be considered here, even though `scipy.signal` supports all three. Filter design generally begins with a specification of the desired frequency response. The filter frequency response may be stated in several ways, but amplitude response is the most common, e.g., state how $H_c(j\\Omega)$ or $H(e^{j\\omega}) = H(e^{j2\\pi f/f_s})$ should behave. A completed design consists of the number of coefficients (taps) required and the coefficients themselves (double precision float or `float64` in Numpy, and `float64_t` in C). Figure 1, below, shows amplitude response requirements in terms of filter gain and critical frequencies for lowpass, highpass, bandpass, and bandstop filters. The critical frequencies are given here in terms of analog requirements in Hz. The sampling frequency is assumed to be in Hz. The passband ripple and stopband attenuation values are in dB. Note in dB terms attenuation is the negative of gain, e.g., -60 of stopband gain is equivalent to 60 dB of stopband attenuation."

    "There are 10 filter design functions and one plotting function available in `fir_design_helper.py`. Four functions for designing Kaiser window based FIR filters and four functions for designing equiripple based FIR filters. Of the eight just described, they all take in amplitude response requirements and return a coefficients array. Two of the 10 filter functions are simply wrappers around the `scipy.signal` function `signal.firwin()` for designing filters of a specific order when one (lowpass) or two (bandpass) critical frequencies are given. The wrapper functions fix the window type to the `firwin` default of hann (hanning). The remamining eight are described below in Table 1. The plotting function provides an easy means to compare the resulting frequency response of one or more designs on a single plot. Display modes allow gain in dB, phase in radians, group delay in samples, and group delay in seconds for a given sampling rate. This function, `freq_resp_list()`, works for both FIR and IIR designs. Table 1 provides the interface details to the eight design functions where d_stop and d_pass are positive dB values and the critical frequencies have the same unit as the sampling frequency $f_s$. These functions do not create perfect results so some tuning of of the design parameters may be needed, in addition to bumping the filter order up or down via `N_bump`."

    "## A Half-Band Filter Design to Pass up to $W/2$ when $f_s = 8$ kHz\n",
    "Here we consider a lowpass design that needs to pass frequencies up to $f_s/4$. Specifically when $f_s = 8000$ Hz, the filter passband becomes [0, 2000] Hz. Once the coefficients are found a `mrh.multirate` object is created to allow further study of the filter, and ultimately implement filtering of a white noise signal.\n",
